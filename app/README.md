# Smart-Attendance

A smart attendance system is a technological solution for automating the attendance-taking process in classrooms or other educational settings. The system utilizes facial recognition to identify and authenticate students in real-time, allowing for more efficient and accurate attendance tracking.The captured data is then processed using machine learning algorithms to identify individual students and record their attendance. The attendance data is stored in a database, which can be accessed by teachers and administrators for tracking and reporting purposes.One of the key benefits of a smart attendance system is that it can save time and reduce errors associated with traditional attendance-taking methods, such as manual paper-based processes.The system can also help improve security in educational settings by ensuring that only authorized students are allowed into the classroom.

Tech stack used-
1) Flutter for application development
2) Machine learning model for face recognition
3) Python
4) Database to store the data
